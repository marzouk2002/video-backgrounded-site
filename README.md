# website with a video background

the main reason why I built this project is as in the title is to learn to create a video background.
And I find out that it's pretty easy. this small project is based on a tutorial from Traversy media (https://youtu.be/8MgpE2DTTKA) so thanks to him for the great content. this page is built using HTML, CSS, and no more than five lines of JS.

Unfortunately, it seems like I wouldn't be able to push the video I used for my background because of its large size. So in case, here is its link:https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-view-of-beautiful-resort-2169880/
