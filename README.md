# website with a video background

the main raison why I built this project is as in the title is to learn to create a video background.
And I find out that it's pretty easy. this small project is based one a tutorial from Traversy media (https://youtu.be/8MgpE2DTTKA) so thanks to him for the the great content. this page is built using HTML, CSS, and no more than five lines of JS.
